<h2>Random language generation tools</h2>
<p><em>last updated 9 May 2010</em></p>

<p>This page describes a set of scripts
for generating various aspects of a conlang.
<ul>
<li><a href="#morphology">morphology</a></li>
<li><a href="#boris">boris</a>, a BNF grammar expander, for phonology and more</li>
<li><a href="#gleb">gleb</a>, for phonology</li>
</ul>
Sorry for the sparsity of the documentation here.
Raise comments of general interest on 
<a href="http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/conlang.html">CONLANG</a>, or write me (Alex Fink) at <tt>000024 gmail.com</tt> with an at sign in between.</p>

<a name="morphology"/><h2>morphology</h2>

<p><a href="morphology.tgz">morphology.pl</a>, by Alex Fink, generates systems of morphological contrasts: case systems, TAM systems, and all that.  The included DOT data files in the directory <tt>noun/</tt> describe a number of common systems of contrasts for nouns (verbs and perhaps other classes are coming, eventually).  Each contrast is a single hypothetical
morphological slot; it is output as a list of values grouped into several lines, where each line is a single form and the elements of that line are its functions.  For example, a case contrast starting
<blockquote>
<tt>intransitive_subject agent experiencer</tt> [...]<br />
<tt>focus patient</tt> [...]<br />
[possibly more lines here]
</blockquote>
describes a nominative-accusative case system.</p>

<p>Invoking morphology.pl with a directory argument as in
<blockquote><tt>perl morphology.pl noun</tt></blockquote>
generates a series of contrasts choosing among all categories
in that directory.  Invoking it with a list of filenames,
<blockquote><tt>perl morphology.pl noun/case.dot noun/number.dot</tt></blockquote>
generates a single contrast fusionally expressing all the named categories.</p>

<a name="boris"/><h2>boris</h2>

<p>To steal Jim Henry's description:
<a href="http://bellsouthpwp.net/j/i/jimhenry1973/conlang/conlang-scripts.zip">boris.pl</a>, originally by John Fisher and much modified by 
[Jim Henry], generates random words given a phonology input file, or random sentences given a grammar input file; but it can also generate format files for itself; see metaphonology.boris and testmeta.sh for examples. </p>

<a name="gleb"/><h2>gleb</h2>

<p><a href="gleb.tgz">gleb.pl</a> (current version 0.2.1), 
by Alex Fink, generates
phonologies and random forms following them.  
You can try it <a href="../cgi-bin/gleb.cgi">online</a>.
The current version handles a limited amount of allophony;
it doesn't yet know about syllables or tone or sundry other things.
Refer to the command-line usage for more.</p>

<p>boris and gleb can't talk to each other right now.</p>
