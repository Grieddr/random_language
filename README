The (unattainable, in its full scope) aim of this project is to procedurally
generate an entire naturalistic human language.  So far the following
two components exist.

- morphology_categories/morphology.pl: systems of morphological contrasts
  (but not their forms).  Data files have been written for nouns.  

- phonology/gleb.pl: phonology, including allophony and other such processes.
