# a big one: final place neutralisation done right.  again a coronal more likely thing
# plosive phonation neutralisation before obstruents -- sometimes, like finally, to aspirates or glottaliseds (often pause alone, so that wants a code change)
# TODO: palatalisation, labialisation, velarisation can be release-timed so should be losable finally or pre-obstruentally (like that phonation)
# retroflexion and apicality most prominent in VC contexts!  they can neutralise initially!
# collect all the flat: velarised, pharyngealised, labialised, retroflex
# Blevins knows of no cases of V-coloring-C coarticulatory effects in pharyngealiseation, creaky or breathy (handled), or rhoticity

# how do we handle sonority decrease being preferred across syllable break?

# nasals going placeless before fricatives
# are retroflexes connected to dorsal?
# anterior > posterior near dorsals maybe, as in ruki
# "trills or flaps have been shown to _lower_ a preceding vowel".  Similarly, when coda rhotics > glides, they should also be predisposed to go to a low one.  How to achieve this?  Perhaps put back [r] > [R]; rather, make tapping of postalveolar approximants not a thing.
# perhaps pre-nasal raising
# dorsal ~ labial exchange before coronals?

# fricatives and unvoiced resonants sometimes becoming _aspirated_ stops

# Note: I took out the table_structure from here.  Gleb 0.2.1a, 
# the version which is currently up as CGI, expects it here;
# uploading this file will break it.

  # Blust 1979: in fact, coronal+non-coronal clusters are more likely to assimilate, or metathesise the coronal before Resonants, than others.  But sibilants are the other way; these are distinctive, and so they metathesise into less salient positions: KsR > sKR, sK(#,O) > Ks(#,O), where K is an obstruent (Steriade 2001).  From Hayes-Kirchner-Steriade [pk] > [kp] is also there. 
  # TODO: rightward place assimilation?  maybe before end of word or optionally more obstruents, as in German with syllabic nasals.  Order this first.  I've also seen [sk] > [st] I think more or less unconditioned; is sibilancy strong enough to do this sometimes?
  # TODO: there is rightward place assimilation to pause.  It's hard to get a compelling behaviour for nasals, just pulling this change out of nowhere; they should either have already spread nasalisation or get repaired to /N/ or velar nasal glide, but usually not simply vanish.

# Not in yet: 
# - preaspirates (mean to do purely as situational breaking of aspirates)
# - prestopping (situational reinforcement w/ a new segment)
# - prenasalised resonants(!)
# - unreleased stops (never contrastive > not to be represented?)
# - superhigh ~ fricative vowels (and note their distribution in Mandarin) (these are representable, it's just that their change infrastructure isn't there.  they yield 'noisy' Cs and C transitions, and should have a fair chance just to go back to resonant vowels)
# - fricative trills
# - whistled sibilants
# - subapicals, and laminal "closed" postalveolars
# - epiglottals, and vowels coarticulated with them = strident Vs
# - voiceless laryngealised obstruents distinct from ejectives
# - linguolabials
# - generation of syllabic Cs
# - clicks
# Then the big ones: tone; stress; length and autosegmentalish timing.

# For syllabic Cs, perhaps we should really just generate deleting the vowel in suitable circumstances.

# (Should the process that unreleases stops do anything to fricatives?)

# Broader problem: there's no real accommodation for marked situations other than spelling out particular resolutions: eg. *sonority increase across a syllable; *tl.  Though maybe Blevins would still give me some idea.
# resonant+glide seems to like to metathesise, though sometimes glide fortition.
